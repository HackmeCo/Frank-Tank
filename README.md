# The Frank Tank

By [RubberDuckies](https://github.com/rubber-duckies)

**The Frank Tank** is a service for discovering and streaming extreme sports videos using the YouTube API, initially developed by [RubberDuckies Dev Team](https://github.com/rubber-duckies). The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rubber-duckies/greenfield)

This fork of the project expands upon the project by adding Facebook OAuth login and the creation of persistent user profiles, which save each user's favorite video clips. Along with the user profiles, we also added a comments section to each video.
